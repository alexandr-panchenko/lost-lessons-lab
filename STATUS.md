## Current blockers

No active credential blocker remains. GitHub CLI authentication, scoped Actions deployment secrets, the `PRODUCTION_URL` repository variable, Cloudflare OAuth, Git push authentication, and local `.dev.vars` are available. Secret values were not printed.

Credentials still reserved for later gates:

- OpenAI production Worker secret at M4;
- final production hostname if a custom domain is used.

## Cut rule

Never cut the bridge hero flow, GPT-5.6 interpretation, deterministic fallback, shared canvas, or real physics to preserve an optional scenario. Cut optional families in this order:

1. structure/load;
2. speed/time;
3. water/volume.
